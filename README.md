# Portfolio website

This project was primarily created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)

## Done (Feb 7, 2021)

- Scaffolded out new project (properly)

## Design Ideas

### Miscellaneous

- Add react-router to site

### Design Choices (musing)

- Add dark theme hook to toggle it (difficult)
- The arrow will bounce, then when you click it, a slide animation will bring up the next part of the page (to add later)
- Will map over data so that code is not repeated after I get the layout finished (add very soon)
- Learn material-ui theming etc. (to do very soon)
- When you hover over links, a golden underline grows under the link (add at some point)
