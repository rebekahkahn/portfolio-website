# Portfolio website

This project was primarily created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)

## Done (Feb 10, 2021)

- Thinking about how I want porfolio section to look

## To Do

- Navbar Toggler to appear when on mobile (and smaler) devices for dropdown men

## Design Ideas

- The arrow will bounce, then when you click it, a slide animation will bring up the next part of the page (to add later)
- Will map over data so that code is not repeated after I get the layout finished (add very soon)
- When you hover over links, a golden underline grows under the link (add at some point)
