# Portfolio website

This project was primarily created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/)

## Done (June 30, 2021)

- Toggling appbar icon and options
- Added portfolio projects with responsive design

## To Do

- Fix the React Native picture (not appearing currently)

## Design Ideas

- Will map over data so that code is not repeated after I get the layout finished
- When you hover over links, a golden underline grows under the link (add at some point)
